During the summer after my first year of my master’s, I returned to Europe for an internship at GMV Space in Lisbon, Portugal. As my first professional experience in the industry, it was an incredible opportunity to learn from and work alongside experts with over 20 years of experience.

I was given the lead on a project in a field I had long been fascinated by—the powered descent of a launch vehicle. This problem presents a unique challenge from a control design perspective, and I had always been intrigued by the algorithms that enable this technology. My task was to develop a control system based on the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion technique. I integrated this system into GMV’s in-house simulation tool and validated its performance, demonstrating improved robustness and adaptability compared to the baseline.

Beyond the technical work, the internship gave me valuable insight into the professional environment of engineering companies working on exciting technology. The experience increased my enthusiasm for joining industry and contribute to innovative projects after graduation.
