<p>
  I was honored to receive full funding for a two-year master’s program at a top U.S. university through the Belgian American Educational Foundation (<a href="https://baef.be/fellowships-for-belgians/" target="_blank">BAEF</a>) Fellowship. This prestigious fellowship is awarded annually to 65 Belgian students, enabling them to pursue graduate studies at leading institutions. Thanks to this support, I am currently pursuing my master’s degree at Stanford University.
