Through ESA's Fly a Rocket program, I had the opportunity to meet an incredible group of international students, many of whom remain close friends to this day. After the program ended, we came together again to submit our findings from the launch campaign to the Symposium on Space Educational Activities. From our group of 24 students, three papers were submitted and accepted for presentation.

I personally presented our findings on the sensor experiments we conducted during the launch campaign. Beyond presenting our own work, the symposium was a fantastic opportunity to connect with professionals in the industry and learn about their research.
