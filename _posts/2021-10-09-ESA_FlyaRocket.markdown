  I had the opportunity to be one of 24 participants in the European Space Agency's <a href="https://www.esa.int/Education/Fly_A_Rocket/Fly_a_Rocket!_programme_launches_cycle_03" target="_blank">Fly a Rocket program</a>. The program takes place primarily at the Andøya Space Center in northern Norway, where we carried out a hands-on rocket launch campaign. Our team devised a scientific mission, selecting several research objectives based on the range of available sensors. Each participant was assigned specific tasks to prepare for the launch, including sensor preparation, integration into the rocket, launching weather balloons to assess atmospheric conditions, and running simulations based on the collected data.

  This program was an incredible opportunity to connect with ambitious students from universities across Europe. Participating early in my university education was especially valuable, as it showed the importance of surrounding myself with driven individuals, learning from each other, and engaging in experiences beyond the standard curriculum. It motivated me to keep pushing myself, continuously learning, and working hard throughout my degree—so that one day, I can contribute to solving fascinating engineering challenges. Below is a photo at the space center with the rocket we launched.
