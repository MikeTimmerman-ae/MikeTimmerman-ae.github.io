<p>
After an incredibly rewarding first year of my bachelor's studies, I was honored to receive the Young Talent Encouragement Award (<a href="https://khmw.nl/verslag-prijsuitreikingen-29-november-2021/" target="_blank">Jong Talent Aanmoedigingsprijs</a>) in Aerospace Engineering from the Royal Dutch Society of Sciences (Koninklijke Hollandse Maatschappij der Wetenschappen). This award is granted annually to the two students with the highest GPA in aerospace engineering in the Netherlands after their first year of study.

Receiving this recognition was especially meaningful as I had just moved to a new country for university, all while navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. It reflects my dedication and eagerness to learn, even in difficult circumstances.
