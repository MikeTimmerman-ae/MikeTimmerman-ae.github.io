<p>
    During the final year of my bachelor's, I had the opportunity to spend a semester on exchange at EPFL in Switzerland. During this time, I took master’s-level courses in robotics, systems, and control, including Model Predictive Control, Machine Learning, and Multivariable Control. It was an enriching experience to be part of a new academic environment while deepening my knowledge in subjects I am passionate about. Beyond academics, I also had the chance to explore Switzerland, taking in its breathtaking landscapes. Below is a picture from a hike where we reached above the clouds.
