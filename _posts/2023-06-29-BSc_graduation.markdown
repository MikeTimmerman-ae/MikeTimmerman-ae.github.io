<p>
  Graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Delft University of Technology. The degree follows the Bologna framework, comprising 180 ECTS (equivalent to three years of full-time study, with 1 ECTS representing 25-30 hours of coursework).
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, I completed the universityâ€™s <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/ae-student-portal/education/bachelor/honours-programme/symposium-2023" target="_blank">Honors Program</a>, an advanced track for top-performing students, which included a research project and specialized courses, totaling 20 extra ECTS beyond the standard curriculum. I presented the results of my research at the program's closing symposium.
</p>
<p>
  I graduated with a 9.0/10 GPA, ranking among the top 1% (~top 3 students) of my class.
